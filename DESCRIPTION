Description: Enables computation of epidemiological statistics, including those 
    where counts or mortality rates of the reference population are used. 
    Currently supported: excess hazard models, rates, mean survival times, 
    relative survival, and standardized incidence and mortality ratios 
    (SIRs/SMRs), all of which can be easily adjusted for by covariates such as 
    age. Fast splitting and aggregation of 'Lexis' objects (from package 'Epi') 
    and other computations achieved using 'data.table'. 
Depends: R (>= 3.2.0)
Imports: Epi (>= 2.0), survival, data.table (>= 1.10.4)
