\arguments{
\item{formula}{a \code{formula}, e.g. \code{FUT ~ V1} or 
\code{Surv(FUT, lex.Xst) ~ V1}.
Supplied in the same way as to \code{\link{survtab}}, see that help

\item{weights}{weights to use to adjust mean survival times. See the
\link[=direct_standardization]{dedicated help page} for more details on 
weighting. \code{survmean}
computes curves separately by all variables to adjust by, computes mean
survival times, and computes weighted means of the mean survival times.
See Examples.}

observed survival in, and the intervals used in estimation. E.g.
\code{list(FUT = 0:10)} when \code{FUT} is the follow-up time scale in your
data.}

\item{pophaz}{a data set of population hazards passed to 
\code{\link{survtab}} (see the 
\link[=pophaz]{dedicated help page} and the help page of
\code{survtab} for more information). Defines the 
population hazard in the time window where observed survival is estimated.}

\item{e1.breaks}{\code{NULL} or a list of breaks defining the time 
window to compute 
\strong{expected} survival in, and the intervals used in estimation. E.g.
\code{list(FUT = 0:100)} when \code{FUT} is the follow-up time scale in your
data to extrapolate up to 100 years from where the observed survival
curve ends. \strong{NOTE:} the breaks on the survival time scale
MUST include the breaks supplied to argument \code{breaks}; see Examples.
If \code{NULL}, uses decent defaults (max follow-up time of 50 years).}

\item{e1.pophaz}{Same as \code{pophaz}, except this defines the

\item{subset}{a logical condition; e.g. \code{subset = sex == 1}; 
subsets the data before computations}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; if \code{TRUE}, the function is returns
some messages and results along the run, which may be useful in debugging}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} (depending on 
\code{getOptions("popEpi.datatable")}; see \code{?popEpi}) containing the
following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{est}{: The estimated mean survival time}
  \item{exp}{: The computed expected survival time}

supplied to the right-hand-side of the formula.

\description{
Computes mean survival times based on survival estimation up to
a point in follow-up time (e.g. 10 years), 
after which survival is extrapolated
using an appropriate hazard data file (\code{pophaz}) to yield the "full"
survival curve. The area under the full survival curve is the mean survival.
}
\details{
\strong{Basics}

\code{survmean} computes mean survival times. For median survival times
(i.e. where 50 % of subjects have died or met some other event)
use \code{\link{survtab}}.

The mean survival time is simply the area under the survival curve.
However, since full follow-up rarely happens, the observed survival curves
are extrapolated using expected survival: E.g. one might compute observed
survival till up to 10 years and extrapolate beyond that 
(till e.g. 50 years) to yield an educated guess on the full observed survival
curve. 

The area is computed by trapezoidal integration of the area under the curve.
This function also computes the "full" expected survival curve from
T = 0 till e.g. T = 50 depending on supplied arguments. The
expected mean survival time is the area under the 
mean expected survival curve.
This function returns the mean expected survival time to be omcpared with 
the mean survival time and for computing years of potential life lost (YPLL).

Results can be requested by strata and adjusted for e.g. age by using
the \code{formula} argument as in \code{survtab}. See also Examples.

\strong{Extrapolation tweaks}

Argument \code{r} controls the relative survival ratio (RSR) assumed to
persist beyond the time window where observed survival is computed
(defined by argument \code{breaks}; e.g. up to \code{FUT = 10}).
The RSR is simply \code{RSR_i = p_oi / p_ei} for a time interval \code{i}, 
i.e. the observed divided by the expected 
(conditional, not cumulative) probablity of surviving from the beginning of
a time interval till its end. The cumulative product of \code{RSR_i}
over time is the (cumulative) relative survival curve. 


If \code{r} is numeric, e.g. \code{r = 0.995}, that RSR level is assumed
to persist beyond the observed survival curve. 
Numeric \code{r} should be \code{> 0} and expressed at the annual level
when using fractional years as the scale of the time variables.
E.g. if RSR is known to be \code{0.95} at the month level, then the
annualized RSR is \code{0.95^12}. This enables correct usage of the RSR
with survival intervals of varying lengths. When using day-level time 
variables (such as \code{Dates}; see \code{as.Date}), numeric \code{r}
should be expressed at the day level, etc.

If \code{r = "auto"} or \code{r = "auto1"}, this function computes
RSR estimates internally and automatically uses the \code{RSR_i}
in the last survival interval in each stratum (and adjusting group)
and assumes that to persist beyond the observed survival curve.
Automatic determination of \code{r} is a good starting point,
but in situations where the RSR estimate is uncertain it may produce poor
results. Using \code{"autoX"} such as \code{"auto6"} causes \code{survmean}
to use the mean of the estimated RSRs in the last X survival intervals, 
which may be more stable.
Automatic determination will not use values \code{>1} but set them to 1. 
Visual inspection of the produced curves is always recommended: see
Examples.

One may also tweak the accuracy and length of extrapolation and 
expected survival curve computation by using 
\code{e1.breaks}. By default this is whatever was supplied to \code{breaks}
for the survival time scale, to which

\code{c(seq(1/12, 1, 1/12), seq(1.2, 1.8, 0.2), 2:19, seq(20, 50, 5))}

is added after the maximum value, e.g. with \code{breaks = list(FUT = 0:10)}
we have 

\code{..., 10+1/12, ..., 11, 11.2, ..., 2, 3, ..., 19, 20, 25, ... 50}

as the \code{e1.breaks}. Supplying \code{e1.breaks} manually requires
the breaks over time survival time scale supplied to argument \code{breaks}
to be reiterated in \code{e1.breaks}; see Examples. \strong{NOTE}: the
default extrapolation breaks assume the time scales in the data to be 
expressed as fractional years, meaning this will work extremely poorly
when using e.g. day-level time scales (such as \code{Date} variables). 
Set the extrapolation breaks manually in such cases.
