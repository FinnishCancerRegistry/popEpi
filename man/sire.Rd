\description{
\code{sire} is a simulated cohort pertaining female Finnish rectal cancer patients
diagnosed between 1993-2012. Instead of actual original dates, the dates are masked
via modest randomization within several time windows.
}
\details{
The closing date for the pertinent data was 2012-12-31, meaning status information was
available only up to that point --- hence the maximum possible \code{ex_date} is \code{2012-12-31}.
