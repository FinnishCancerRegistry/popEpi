\title{popEpi: Functions for large-scale epidemiological analysis}
\description{
\pkg{popEpi} is built for the needs of registry-based (large-scale)
epidemiological analysis. This is in most part enabled by the
efficient \pkg{data.table} package for handling and aggregating large data sets.

\pkg{popEpi} currently supplies some utility functions such as \code{\link{splitMulti}}
and \code{\link{get.yrs}} for preparing large data sets for epidemiological analysis.
Included are also a a few functions that can be used in
epidemiological analysis such as \code{\link{sir}} for estimating
standardized incidence/mortality ratios (SIRs/SMRs) and \code{\link{survtab}} for
estimating observed and relative/net survival as well as cumulative incidence
functions (CIFs). In particular, \code{survtab} implements the Ederer II
(Ederer and Heise (1959)) and
Pohar Perme estimators (Pohar Perme, Stare, and Esteve (2012)
\doi{10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01640.x}) and allows for easy
age-standardisation.

Since there are many benefits to using \code{data.tables}, \pkg{popEpi} returns
outputs by default in the \code{data.table} format where appropriate.
Since \code{data.table}
objects are usually modified by reference, this may have surprising side
effects for users uninitiated in using \code{data.table}. To ensure
that appropriate outputs are in the \code{data.frame} format, set
\code{options("popEpi.datatable" = FALSE)}. However, \code{data.table}
usage is recommended due to better performance and testing coverage.
\code{data.table} is used
by most functions internally in both cases.
