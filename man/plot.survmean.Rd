\usage{
\method{plot}{survmean}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{survmean} object}

\item{...}{arguments passed (ultimately) to \code{matlines}; you
may, therefore, supply e.g. \code{xlab} through this, though arguments
such as \code{lty} and \code{col} will not work}
}
\description{
Plots the observed (with extrapolation) and expected survival
curves for all strata in an object created by \code{\link{survmean}}
}
\details{
For examples see \code{\link{survmean}}. This function is intended only
for graphically inspecting that the observed survival curves with extrapolation
and the expected survival curves have been sensibly computed in \code{survmean}.

If you want finer control over the plotted curves, extract the curves from
the \code{survmean} output using 

\code{attr(x, "curves")}

where \code{x} is a \code{survmean} object.
