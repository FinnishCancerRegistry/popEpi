\title{Confidence intervals for the rate ratios}
\usage{
rate_ratio(x, y, crude = FALSE, SE.method = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a rate-object, vector of two; rate and standard error or observed and person-years.}

\item{y}{a rate-object, vector of two; rate and standard error or observed and person-years.}

\item{crude}{set TRUE to use crude rates; default is FALSE.}

\item{SE.method}{default TRUE; if \code{x} and \code{y} are vectors of observed and 
person-years, this must be changed to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A vector length of three: rate_ratio, and lower and upper confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Calculate rate ratio with confidence intervals for rate objects or observations and person-years.
}
\details{
Calculate rate ratio of two age standardized rate objects (see \code{\link{rate}}). 
Multiple rates for each objects is supported if there are an equal number of rates. 
Another option is to set \code{x} and \code{y} as a vector of two.
\enumerate{
  \item rate and its standard error, and  set \code{SE.method = TRUE}.
  \item observations and person-year, and  set \code{SE.method = FALSE}.
}
See examples.
